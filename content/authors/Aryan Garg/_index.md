I am an Undergraduate Student originally from the Bay Area studying Computer Science, Public Policy, and Mathematics planning to graduate in 2026 from Vanderbilt University. My research interests include Deep Learning and novel new models we can use to solve problems in the world. Outside of research, I love running, reading, and travel photography!
