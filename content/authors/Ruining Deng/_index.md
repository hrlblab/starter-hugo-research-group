My name is Ruining Deng from Wuhan, China. Before joining Vanderbilt, I received my Bachelor's degree from China University of Mining and Technology, Beijing. I had an independent research experience at the University of Notre Dame in 2018 as a visiting student, focusing on radiology segmentation and cardiovascular signal processing.

Currently, I am working with Dr. Huo on pathological image analysis in Deep learning, which explores clinical knowledge and assists diagnosis in a data-driven way.
