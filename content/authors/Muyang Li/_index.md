I'm currently a first-year MS student in Computer Science at Vanderbilt University, supervised by Prof. Yuankai Huo. My research interests include medical image analysis, neural network and computer vision.

Before I joined Vanderbilt University, I received my B.S degree from the University of Michigan - Shanghai Jiao Tong University Joint Institute in 2023. 

Outside of research, I love books, sports and video games.
