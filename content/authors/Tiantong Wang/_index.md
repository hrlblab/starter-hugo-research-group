I'm currently a first-year MS student in Computer Science at Vanderbilt University, supervised by Prof. Yuankai Huo. My research interests include computer vision, software engineering, robotics and so on.â€‹

Before I joined Vanderbilt University, I received my B.S degree from the Department of Computer Science at the Beijing University of Technology in 2023. 

Outside of research, I am keen on playing basketball and I am a big fan of rock music.
