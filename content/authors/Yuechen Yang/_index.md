I am currently a first-year Ph.D. student at Vanderbilt University, supervised by Professor Yuankai Huo. My primary research area is medical image processing, with a particular focus on Pathomics. I obtained my M.S. degree in Data Science from Vanderbilt University in 2022 and my B.S. degree in Software Engineering from Central South University in 2020.
 
Outside of my research, I enjoy reading and listening to music!
