Iâ€™m currently a first-year MS student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Vanderbilt University. My research interests include medical image processing, computer vision and machine learning.

Before I jointed Vanderbilt University, I received my B.S degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Joint Institute of Shanghai Jiao Tong University and University of Michigan (UM-SJTU JI) in 2023.

Outside of research, I like painting, hiking and traveling.
