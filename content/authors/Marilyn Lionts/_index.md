I'm currently a first-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Vanderbilt University, supervised by Dr. Yuankai Huo and Dr. Anita Mahadevan-Jansen. My research interests include medical image analysis, deep learning, and data science. Before I joined Vanderbilt University, I received a B.S. in Mathematics from the University of Texas at Austin in 2023.
 
Outside of academics, I like rock climbing and pickleball.
