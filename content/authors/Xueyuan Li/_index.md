I am a second-year MS student in Data Science at Vanderbilt University, supervised by Prof. Yuankai Huo. My research interests include medical image analysis, deep learning, and Software Development.
​
Before I joined Vanderbilt University, I received my B.S degree from the Department of Computer and Information Engineering at Henan University in 2022. 
​
My current research direction is Medical Image Segmentation.
 
Outside of research, I love hiking.
