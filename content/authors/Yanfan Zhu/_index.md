I am currently a first-year MS student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Vanderbilt University. My research interests primarily lie in medical image analysis, computer vision, deep learning, and embedded applications.

Before I joined Vanderbilt University, I received my M.S degree from the Department of Embedded and Cyber-Physical System at University of California - Irvine in 2022. And I received my B.S degree from the Department of Computer Science and Technology at Shanghai University in 2020. 

Outside of my academic and research endeavors, I have a passion for street dance and music production.
