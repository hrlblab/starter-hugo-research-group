I am a third-year undergraduate student in Biomedical Engineering and Chemical Engineering at Vanderbilt University, working under the guidance of Dr. Yuankai Huo. My research focuses on AI-Enhanced Diagnosis and Monitoring of Eosinophilic Esophagitis.

When I'm not immersed in research, I enjoy biking and exploring Nashville with friends.
