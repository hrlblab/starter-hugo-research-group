I'm a 2nd-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Vanderbilt University supervised by Professor Yuankai Huo. I got my bacholar degree from Huazhong University. I spent my summer semester of 2016 as an exchange student at the Stanford University. I majored in Computer Engineering in Case Western Reserve University from 2018 to 2020.

My research interests are broadly in medical image analysis, deep learning methods, and artificial intelligence, with a current focus on self-supervised learning.
