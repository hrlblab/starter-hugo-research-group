I'm currently a Master student in Computer Science at Vanderbilt University, supervised by Prof. Yuankai Huo. My research interests include medical image analysis, deep learning, and GPU.
â€‹
Before I joined Vanderbilt University, I received my MEng degree from the Department of Computer Software and Theory at the Northeastern University in 2021. And I received my Bachelor of Engineering degree from Department of Electronic and Information Engineering  at Shenyang University of Technology in 2017.  

 
Outside of research, I love reading and cooking.
