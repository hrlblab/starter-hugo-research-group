I am a 4th year computer science major at Vanderbilt University from Wake Forest, North Carolina studying the applications of generative AI in denoising and de-obscuring of microscopic medical images under the guidance of Dr. Huo. 

When I am not working, I enjoy playing soccer, running, photography and hanging out with friends
Outside of research, I love running, playing soccer, photography and hanging out with friends!
