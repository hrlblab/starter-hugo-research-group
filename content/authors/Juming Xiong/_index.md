I'm currently a first-year Ph.D. student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Vanderbilt University, supervised by Prof. Yuankai Huo. My research interests include medical image analysis, deep learning, and data science.
​
Before I joined Vanderbilt University, I received my M.S degree from the Department of Biomedical Engineering at Duke University in 2023. And I received my B.S degree from the Department of Computer Science at Auburn University in 2021.

Outside of research, I love cooking and playing video games.
