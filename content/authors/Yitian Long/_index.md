I'm currently a second-year M.S. student in Data Science at Vanderbilt University, My research interests include medical image analysis, transformers & large language model (LLM), deep learning, and data science.

â€‹Before I joined Vanderbilt University, I received my B.A degree from the Faculty of Humanities and Arts at Macau University of Science and Technology in 2023. 

My current research direction is multimodal learning for disease diagnosis and prognosis.

Outside of research, I love social science and movies.
