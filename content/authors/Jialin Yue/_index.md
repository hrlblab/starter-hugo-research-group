I'm a first-year graduate student in Electrical and Computer Engineering program at Vanderbilt University, supervised by Prof. Yuankai Huo. My research interests include medical image processing and machine learning.

Before I joined Vanderbilt University,I received my B.S degree from Zhengzhou University in 2021. 
 
Outside of research, I love painting, singing and poetry.
