I'm currently a junior studying Computer Science, Mathematics, and Data Science at Vanderbilt University, supervised by Prof. Yuankai Huo. My research interests include machine learning, artificial intelligence, and deep learning.
 
Outside of academics, I enjoy listening to music, camping, and indoor rock climbing.
