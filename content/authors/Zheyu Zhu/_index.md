I am currently a senior student majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics. My academic interest lies in
Medical Image Analysis, Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning. I have been working with Dr. Huo for about two years, and under his supervision, I have published several papers in both conferences and Journals, including a first author paper called 'EasierPath: An Open-source Tool for Human-in-the-loop Deep Learning of Renal Pathology
'. My personal interests include hiking(trails!!), cooking great food and watching movies.
