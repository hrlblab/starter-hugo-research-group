I’m currently a MS student in Electrical Engineering at Vanderbilt University. I received my B.S degree from the Department of Physics at Wuhan University in 2019. ​My current research interests lies on biomedical image processes and machine learning. Besides, I like playing badminton, eating delicious foods and traveling apart from academics.
