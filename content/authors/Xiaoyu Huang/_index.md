I am currently an undergraduate student at Vanderbilt University, double majoring in Applied Mathematics and Computer Science with a minor in Economics. My academic focus includes artificial intelligence, deep learning, and software development.

Outside of academics, I enjoy cooking, traveling, reading, video gaming, and playing with my lovely cat.
