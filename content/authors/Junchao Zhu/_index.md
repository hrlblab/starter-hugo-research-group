I'm currently a first-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Vanderbilt University, supervised by Prof. Yuankai Huo. My research interests include medical image analysis, deep learning, and computer vision. Before I joined Vanderbilt University, I received my B.S degree from the School of Life Sciences and Biotechnology at Shanghai Jiao Tong University in 2024. My current research direction is deep learning for large-scale pathology image processing. Outside of research, I love baseball and cooking.
