I'm currently a sophomore undergraduate student studying Computer Science, Mathematics and Business at Vanderbilt University, supervised by Prof. Yuankai Huo. My research interests include artificial intelligence, deep learning, and data science.

I am originally from Madison, WI but recently moved to New Jersey.  
 
Outside of research and academics, I enjoy playing soccer, tennis, the saxophone, various cue sports (pool, snooker) and listening to music
