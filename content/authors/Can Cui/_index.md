I'm currently a third-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Vanderbilt University, supervised by Prof. Yuankai Huo. My research interests include medical image analysis, deep learning, and data science.
​
Before I joined Vanderbilt University, I received my M.S degree from the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Michigan-Ann Arbor in 2019. And I received my B.S degree from the Department of Electronic and informatics Engineering at Beijing Jiaotong University in 2017. 
​
My current research direction is multimodal learning for disease diagnosis and prognosis.
 
Outside of research, I love dancing and cooking.
