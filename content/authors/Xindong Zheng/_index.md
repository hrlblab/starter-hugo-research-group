I'm currently a first-year graduate student in Computer Science at Vanderbilt University, supervised by Prof. Yuankai Huo. My research interests include medical image analysis, deep learning, computer vision and large vision models.

Before I joined Vanderbilt University, I received my B.Eng degree from the Department of Electronic Engineering at Fudan University in 2024.
 
Outside of research, I love hiking and video games.
