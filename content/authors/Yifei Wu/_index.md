I'm currently a first-year MS student in Computer Science at Vanderbilt University, supervised by Prof. Yuankai Huo. My research interests include medical image analysis, deep learning, and data science.

Before I joined Vanderbilt University, I received my B.S degree from the Department of Mechatronics Engineering at Tongji University in 2023.
 
During the spare time, I enjoy playing the piano.
