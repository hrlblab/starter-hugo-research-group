Hi, I am currently a first-year Master student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Vanderbilt University, supervised by Dr. Yuankai Huo. My research interests include deep learning, medical image analysis, and software engineering, 
​
I received my B.S degree in Electrical Engineering from University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign in 2023. 
​
Outside of research, I love musics and film. I also enjoy hitting the trails for a good hike.
