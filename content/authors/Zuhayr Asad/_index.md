I'm currently an Undergraduate Researcher in Computer Science at Vanderbilt University, supervised by Prof. Yuankai Huo. My research interests include image mining, machine learning, and data science. Before I joined Vanderbilt University, I took bioengineering, physics, and mathematics courses at the University of Louisville. Outside of research, I love playing pickup basketball, cooking, and going to Jeni's Ice Cream Shop.
