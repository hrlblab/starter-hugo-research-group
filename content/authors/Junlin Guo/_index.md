I'm currently a third-year Ph.D. student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Vanderbilt University, supervised by Prof. Mitch Wilkes and Prof. Yuankai Huo. My research interests include medical image analysis, deep learning, computer vision, Brain study and so on.
​
Before I joined Vanderbilt University, I received my B.S degree from Northeastern University in 2017, with major in telecommunication engineering. And I received my M.S degree from the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Vanderbilt University in 2020, focusing on fMRI Brain activation study. 
​
My research interests are in medical imaging, deep learning, computer vision and brain functions. Outside of research, I enjoy cooking and traveling!
